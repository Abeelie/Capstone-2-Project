Capstone-2-Project
The title of my site is AI Study. The website link is the following, https://ai-study.netlify.app/

AI-Study is a platform dedicated to providing students with the tools they need to have efficient study sessions. This is accomplished by integrating speech recognition and speech utterance technology that listens for the user input as well as talks to the user to perform tasks. Examples of tasks are performing book searches, news searches, youtube searches, translation of words, perform simple math problems, definition of words, temperature of cities, and provide motivational quotes while studying. To try it, turn on the mic and say commands to get started.

Features:

Create Read Delete todo's and Flashcard data
Rest API for the registered users, todo and flashcards

Speech recognition and utterance API

User Flow
A first-time user can visit the website and access the voice services by
clicking on the mic. The user can explore the many commands that provide
YouTube videos, news, meaning of words, and perform CRUD operations on todo data. In addition, the user is able to have one on one video chats with other
users and create their own private chatrooms with friends. A user is able to login and register. Once logged in, a user is able to create a flashcard set, quiz themselves and have access to a dashboard where all their flashcards will be listed.
